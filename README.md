# Games-in-Python
This repository contains games created in python using pygame library.

## Memory PuZZle
In the Memory Puzzle game, several icons are covered up by white boxes. There are two of each icon. The player can click on two boxes to see what icon is behind them. If the icons match, then those boxes remain uncovered. The player wins when all the boxes on the board are uncovered. To give the player a hint, the boxes are quickly uncovered once at the beginning of the game.

## Slide PuZZle
The board is a 4x4 grid with fifteen tiles (numbered 1 through 15 going left to right) and one blank space. The tiles start out in random positions, and the player must slide tiles around until the tiles are back in their original order.

## Simulate
Simulate is a clone of the game Simon. There are four colored buttons on the screen. The buttons light up in a certain random pattern, and then the player must repeat this pattern by pressing the buttons in the correct order. Each time the player successfully simulates the pattern, the pattern gets longer. The player tries to match the pattern for as long as possible.
